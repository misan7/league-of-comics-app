# League of Comics Angular App

This repository contains our first team app project developed with AngularJS.  Our app allows you to search **comics** and find information about them like covers, publish dates and a description of the volume. The API we used is called **[Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/)** and we apprecciate their support!

The app was coded  with the text editor [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
